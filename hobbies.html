        <p class="centered-text">Your first question must be: "Robby must have many hobbies! The man's name rhymes with it right?"</p>
        <p class="centered-text">Well to be blunt, I only have one main hobby that I would like to talk about.</p>
        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p class="centered-text">My main and most favorite past-time is playing video games, specifically on the computer. Video games are my favorite form of media since <strong>you</strong> are the one that is interacting with it. I will list a few of my most played games, a brief description, and a link to their websites by clicking the image.</p>

        <div class="centered-text"><p>I know you have heard of World of Warcraft at least once in your lifetime. Having the stigma of being the nerdiest game to ever be created, World of Warcraft has changed my life. I started playing in late <em>Cataclsym</em> (the third expansion), which was around late 2011.<br>World of Warcraft is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) where you create a custom character, complete quests, fight bosses, and gather upgrades to your gear to get stronger. World of Warcraft is a cornerstone for <strong>ALL</strong> MMORPG's that have been created since its existence.</div></p>
        <h3 class="centered-text">Before moving onto the next video game, I will share my favorite classes in the game with a little description:</h3>
        <ol class="wow-class-list">
            <li>
                <span class="class-name druid">Druid</span>
                <ul class="wow-list">
                    <li>Druids are like nature people that can do it all.</li>
                    <li>They can heal others, tank damage for their party, or do incredible damage.</li>
                    <li>They can shapeshift into different animal forms including: cat, bear, cheetah, bird, sea lion, and moonkin (which is like a weird chicken man, see below).</li>
                    <li class="wow-image"><img src="imgs/moonkin.jpg" alt="moonkin form" width="150"></li>

                <ul class="wow-list">
                    <li>Warriors are very simple, hit thing with big sword fast and hard.</li>
                    <li>They may be simple but are considered one of the most popular classes in the game.</li>
                    <li>They can also do this, which is really fun and does a lot of damage.</li>

                    <li>They use their fists to fight and are extremely mobile.</li>
                    <li>Their most fun move is called "fists of fury" I can't find a good gif, but it kinda looks like this:</li>

        <h2>Next game:</h2>
        <div class="centered"><a href="https://playvalorant.com/" target="_blank"><img src="imgs\val.png" alt="valorant logo with link to site" width="400"></a></div>
        <div class="centered-text"><p>I spent a good amount of time talking about World of Warcraft, so this will be the last game I talk about, and I'll make it brief.<br><br>Valorant is a tactical first person shooter game where you have to stand still to shoot accurately. The game is played in rounds and it is first to thirteen. It is 5 versus 5 and the teams take turns attacking and defending. The objective for the attackers is to plant the bomb at one of the sites and ensure that it explodes to win the round. The defenders goal is to eliminate all attackers and/or defuse the bomb if it gets planted. As of right now, there are currently 22 different characters to play as, each offering 4 different abilities and fulfilling different roles. I will not go into detail about the different roles or agents, but I prefer to play duelists. The duelist's job is to get onto the bomb site to "take space" and eliminate any defenders using the tools in their kit. Jett is my personal favorite, she is very fun to play. I'll include a little picture of her below:</p></div>
